# Swingler
v1.0 Swingler

Originally a physics simulation of pendulums. Uses SHM physics formulas to determine position, velocity, and acceleration vectors of pendulum motion. After careful consideration, I transformed the simulation into an android minigame which involves using pendulums to drop a ball into a white "goal" far at the bottom of the screen. This program is a work-in-progress, alongside several other android mobile apps that I hope to soon upload to the Google Play Store.
